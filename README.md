# Apache-Forward-Proxy
An Ubuntu ``.deb`` package to provision an Apache Forward Proxy Server.

## Introduction
[Setting up an Apache Forward Proxy server](https://watilearnd2day.wordpress.com/2017/06/23/how-to-setup-an-apache-forward-proxy-server-on-ubuntu-14-04/) on Ubuntu is an easy task, if you know how to do it. But what if you don't want to spend time configuring the settings & struggling with other relevant tasks? I have created an Ubuntu ``.deb`` package that provisions a fully functional Apache Forward Proxy server in less than a minute. No configuration needed! Just execute the utility after installing the package & lo!! You are done :-)

## Installation
Installation is as easy as it can be on any Ubuntu system. Just execute : - 
```
root@shashank-dbserver:/home/shashank# dpkg -i apache-forward-proxy_1.0-1_all.deb
```
You can get the ``.deb`` package from [here](https://github.com/shashank-ssriva/Apache-Forward-Proxy/releases)

## Usage
After installing, it is available as a command called ``apache-forward-proxy``. Just run it & it will take care of rest of the things :-)
